There's a difference.  ``You're an idiot,`` is an ad hominem attack.  It is a baseless insult with no constructive intention.  ``Rubbish`` is an ad hominem attack.  There is nothing constructive other than an insult of another contributors work.  Telling fiddle they he or she has an ``arrogant obtuse attitude`` was constructive with the intention of advice on how to better deal with new posters.  ``Instead of posting rubbish`` is both an arrogant and insulting statement.  It did nothing to help me create a better article, OR give reasons why the SKK article was being deleted.  ``Rubbish`` is not an objective criteria.  ``This article has already been posted & debated`` is.  Of course this fact never was brought up until after the discussion was well out of hand.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, you cannot with any intellectual honesty characterize what I posted as ``vandalism.``  My repeated intention was to make a sincere contribution of a topic that I felt is important.

I literally barely had time to type a few words before the article was again deleted with absolutely zero discussion or valid justification.

Maybe you really have dealt with too many vandals, and were quick to lump me in with whatever hooligans you may be used to dealing with.  If I really wanted to be a vandal, I could easily use an ip proxy to keep posting & causing trouble here.  There would be little that you could do about it, but that is not who I am.

Reports from CNN that 46 people were killed on Monday. As we discuss this, the Syrian Armed forces (Army, Republican Guard, etc.) are trading hot rounds of lead with the Free Syrian Army. Also, a neighborhood was shelled and snipers continue hunt activists like they're animals. I read from Yahoo News that 9 soldiers from the Syrian Army (pro-Assad) were killed and many more wounded, the same day 46 others (anti-Assad) were killed. Therefore it's clear there has become a constant exchange in gunfire and violence overall. I think you can either call this a Civil War or perhaps a Revolution, but it's quite clear (to me at least) that the uprising is over and Syria is now a war zone. After months of violence that ranged from smaller domestic disurbances to riots with people being killed, the United States decides to close their embassy and get all of their diplomats out of the country. Why now and not earlier? This is another sign that things are getting worse.

At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name.

Note I have in the past used German articles as references... if that is what you mean. I am still working on the article and remains incomplete.

You made some good points, but the request's supporters made better ones. Your opposing vote contained the following text:NEWLINE_TOKEN::Furthermore, the reason given for moving is in itself offensive. The title is objective, and the objection to it seems to be only that it doesn't adequately conform to Laval's own beliefs about what is motivating the contributors to this article. In the absence of any evidence that we're bigots, I suggest the correct move is for Laval either to demonstrate we're bigots or to apologize for slandering us.NEWLINE_TOKEN::This violates WP:AGF in the first sentence, and continues to be something akin to a personal attack. I am sure that your comments were sincere, but I think both sides allowed themselves to get riled and to speak too rashly. Your point about original research was more significant, but the term ``Anti-Quebec sentiment`` does seem to be in fairly widespread use (I did check).NEWLINE_TOKEN::A person doesn't have to vote to voice an opinion. The instructions at the top of every poll state ``Please remember that this survey is not a vote``, so the fact that I've inferred opinions from other parts of the debate is not a problem. It seems that 205.157.110.11 (an IP, but one with a very strong history of contructive edits) would have made an explicit vote were it not for the hot-headed wording of the proposal, and GTBacchus (an editor who I have yet to see make a mistake) also supported a very similar title. Laval, the move's proponent supported his move, of course; tjstrf proposed an alternative title, which garnered little support, and ``Marc Gévry`` commented more on the debate than the title. This makes 3 ``votes`` in favour of ``Anti-Quebec sentiment[s]``, and one (yourself) directly opposed. Characterising votes for alternative titles as either support or opposition for the quoted proposal cannot be accurately done, so I omitted those from the count (but took them into consideration for the decision, of course).NEWLINE_TOKEN::I don't approve of returning to debates once they've been closed, and I really think you should move on.

Or you can have the system send an SMS text message (not a premium rate message) to your mobile phone.

Kurds have it in their homes and are allowed to have them. It is certainly not criminal in Iran for Kurds to have the Kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do. So edit your statement about it being criminal in Iran. Need I remind you all, that Kurds are ethnic Iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in Iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination Kurds face in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey?  NEWLINE_TOKENIt is usually Israeli sources, with increasing American and British help and aid, that intentionally falsely claim that the Kurdish flag (which fly the Pan-Iranian colours as does the unofficial flag of the Azerbaijani people and the flag of Tajikistan) is prohibited in Iran. FLYING THE KURDISH FLAG IN IRAN IS NOT CRIMINAL AS IT IS MENTIONED BY ISRAELI SOURCES. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFurthermore, I go on to read that there was research done that basically proves Kurds and Jews are genetically the same. It seems to me that certain individuals who I can see are Israeli are following the Israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the Middle East. Kurds are Iranians just as how Russians, Serbs, Poles, and Bulgarians are all Slavic peoples. Israel, the USA, and Britain are trying to create conflict in Iran as was done in the former Yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines. This is called ‘balkanisation.’ The Israelis are doing this covertly through operations in Iraqi Kurdistan.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPropaganda for dividing and conquering people starts with definitions then the manipulation of history. I am an academic in the fields of anthropology and history and an Iranian from a minority group that is neither Persian nor Kurdish. I can tell you that Kurds are definitely ethnic Iranians in all senses from tradition to language, history, culture, identity, and genetics. I am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the Iranian identity of Kurds. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I was told by a Kurdish professor, Mr. Eskandari in Tehran: “Kurds are Iranian and the entity of Iran as a state and nation was founded by the [main] ancestors of the Kurds, the Mede who established Iran as an empire. One problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term Persian and Iranian. Persians are Iranian, but all Iranians, like the Kurds and Ossetians, are not Persians.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Mede and other similar Iranian groups are the ancestors of the Kurds, but not the only group, just like how the ancient Persians are the main ancestors of the modern Persians, but not the only ancestors. Ancestors of Persians and Kurds also include Arabs, Mongols, and other Iranian peoples. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI ask all the honest people on this site who wish to enhance knowledge not to take part in this fabrication of fact. There was a time when the Turkish government tried to convince Kurds that they were “Mountain Turks” and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the Kurds from their Iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young Kurds forget or be unaware of their Iranian ethnicity. This is due to geo-strategic schemes. These forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely Iranian. The covert foreign policy of Israel, Britain, and America comes at the expense of the Kurds and even their history and culture.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“THE ENEMIES OF SCIENCE, THE ARTS, AND KNOWLEDGE ARE THE ENEMIES OF ALL MANKIND!”",2006,False,article,blocked,dev

Ellis emphasizes ``congestion``, which i take to imply that the pain reflects failure to release the eleveated local blood pressure resulting from failure to relieve the engorgement of the genitals that is crucial to erection, i.e., a condition related to the ``pain and tenderness`` of priapism.

The real issue is indeed plain ``release``, or rather release of either sympathetic or parasympathetic (never could remember which is which) nervous-system excitation, which in turn entails destimulation of sphincter-like structures that sustain the engorgement (and that ED-medications work by affecting).NEWLINE_TOKEN 21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)`",2004,True,article,random,dev

A method book, I might add, with proven misinformation contained therein. Among many errors in that book: In the front matter the author states falsely that ``Narciso Yepes [...] heard that there were four tones with less sustain due to missing sympathetic resonance on the six-string guitar``. That is, even though Yepes ubiquitously indicates eight (not four) missing resonances in various articles and interviews as referenced here as well as in his Speech of Ingression into the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando delivered on 30 April 1989: ``The strings that I have added incorporate all the natural resonance that the instrument lacked in eight of the twelve notes of the equal tempered scale.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDespite discussing this last issue with you numerous times, you still made the folowing statement: ``there is no misinformation on the particular page to which I linked. Both sides are describing the same eight notes being provided by the same four resonant strings. Whether that is four ``resonances`` or eight is a non-issue.``  That is, even though eight clearly does not equal four and both sides are clearly not describing the same thing, you still defend your support of misinformation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEven though I've explained this before, and my site explains it in detail, I will say it again:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe western musical scale has 12 notes per octave. On the guitar, Yepes observed, four of these when palyed on a treble string induced a unison resonance from a bass string. These four notes are E, A, B, and D. If any octave of any of these notes is played on a treble string, a bass string reproduces it in unison. If A5 is played, A5 is reproduced by resonance on a bass string. Yepes observed that the other eight notes do not have the same resonance. These are C, C#, D#, F, F#, G, G#, A#. By adding four strings to the guitar tuned a singular way (C, A#, G#, F#), all twelve notes of the octave, played anywhere on the treble strings, now have unison resonances from bass strings. If C#4 is played C#4 is reproduced on string 10 (F#). If F#4 is palyed, F#4 is reproduced on strign 10 by resonance. If both C#4 and F#4 ar played, string 10 produces both the pitch of C#4 and the pitch of F#4 simultaneously. This is a proven fact of acoustics.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf Janet Marlow claims there are only ``four missing resonances on the six string guitar`` (and in her book even attributes this to ``Narciso Yepes``), it is totally false. Yepes said eight missing resonances (C, C#, D#, F, F#, G, G#, A#) not four (C, Bb, Ab, Gb). Marlow knows that because she has (in Soundboard magazine) referenced an interview with Yepes (Snitzler, L. 1978. ``Narciso Yepes: The 10-String Guitar: Overcoming the Limitations of Six Strings``. Guitar Player 12: p. 26.) in which Yepes very clearly indicates which notes do and do not have resonance. Yet she has published at least twice the disinformation that Yepes added four strings (resonators) because four resonances were missing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you still have a problem understanding this, I am happy to meet with you and illustrate it on an actual 10-string guitar, since you've never owned/played one.NEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`",2009,True,user,blocked,dev

It would be good to add Japanese sources to the gaming articles to expand their reception sections because the inclusion of sources from different nationalities helps to reduce systemic bias and POV.

Also, Jones never accused David Mayer de Rothschild personally of being the head of a neo-feudal empire, he did however infer that his family was involved with such.  Rothschild repeatedly accused Jones of being an oil baron, which is absurd and ironic considering the Rothschild investments in big oil.

You might think ``most`` readers want to know the history of the garment.  I think ``most`` readers are people who like horses and want to know about riding clothing, thus a modern focus is needed.  And we cannot break this impasse because I am pretty sure that no one has taken a poll of what readers of wikipedia want to know about jodhpurs.  There is a place for a history section, but there already is a link to the Maharaja, so a lot of what you proposed probably needs to go there.  But for the ref, links to images are seldom accessed anyway,so footnoting is perfectly proper and in line with wikipedia's manual of style. If the actual images can uploaded to commons, then I think adding one good historical image to the article is useful, but otherwise, they are awkward in the text.  I also have no beef with clarifying that they aren't precisely breeches, as they go to the ankle, except that no one has yet provided a dictionary definition or either term.  One problem is that you and I both noticed that flared-hip breeches worn with tall boots get called ``jodhpurs`` in popular culture (the aviator/Hollywood/Military look), even thought they are technically breeches.

Yes, I've done a lot of work there, but am tightly constrained in how much I can reveal regarding the sources of any so-called ``original research`` material. Suffice it to say that I was privileged to work in the Dept of Physics at Auckland University (NZ), aged 19, as a research assistant (40+ years ago), where I made friends with a few young doctoral students, one of whom was researching gravitational waves. I then studied physics at the University of Canterbury, under Prof. Roy Kerr, the rotating black hole theorist. I've kept in touch with a few of those guys over the years, and they've introduced me to certain other ``big names`` in physics. I bailed out of the academy before gaining a doctorate, preferring a broad interdisciplinary education, and disgusted by the stress, pressure, politics, and the close-minded arrogance of certain professional academics. I had a fun life instead, and followed my curiosity about gravitation, astrophysics and cosmology in a totally relaxed way. Over the past decade or so, I've been privy to hearing about some very exciting developments in theoretical physics, particularly with regards to the unification problem. I can't say too much, because *cough* Nobel *cough*. If, just saying, somebody (hypothetically) had actually nailed the spin-2 boson, but hadn't yet published anything until it's mathematically robust, peer-reviewed, etc, then it's (hypothetically) highly likely that the solution would involve a mathematical toolkit comprising complex dimensional analysis, multi-dimensional special & general relativity, loop quantum gravity, E8 Theory, etc. Just wildly speculating here, but it's the 100th anniversary of Einstein's publication of GR — could be a very big year for physics.

Olle Engstrand (a professor of phonetics at Stockholm University), ``Fonetikens grunder`` (``The basics of phonetics``), 2004, page 120 (my translation):NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::All languages have more or less significant regional variations in pronunciation. In Swedish there are differences in the spoken varieties of the standard language (``Scanian``, ``Gutnish`` or ``Dalecarlian``) as well as variations specific to certain cities [``stadsmål``] like ``Stockholmska`` or ``Göteborska``. By ``dialect`` Swedish dialectologists are refering to those local dialects [``bygdemål``, ``landsmål``] that have a straight lineage that can be traced back to Old Norse, a history shared with all other Scandinavian dialects - these form a continuum while the distinct ``national languages`` like Swedish, Danish and Norweigan are relativly recent constructions.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:This is confirmed by Claes-Christian Elert (professor of phonetics at Umeå University 1969-1988) in ``Allmän och svensk fonetik`` (``General and Swedish phonetics``) on pages 34-35. Here are some selected passages (again my translation):NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::For a long time there has existed speech varieties within the Swedish language area which are used only in certain communities and which have only been slightly influenced by the spoken varieties of central Sweden or by the written language. These are the genuine dialects [the bold font is in the book].NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::[...]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The variety of language that a visitor to a community encounters most of the time is not the genuine dialect but a reginal speech variety [again Elert's bolding]. Sometimes the standard language is spoken with regional influences. Contrary to the genuine dialects, the regional varieties are almost identical to the central standard language [``det centrala riksspråket``] in terms of inflection and syntax. Vocabulary is usually also more or less identical, though some local deviations do exist. It is above all the pronunciation of vowels and consonants as well as prosody of the regional variations that deviate from the standard language. Generally these are similar to the genuine dialects within the same region. The regional standard varieties do not differ as much from one community to another as the genuine dialects.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:If you interpret these quotes very generously (that is, not according to what the writers intended), you might be able to support SIL's claims, though not the figures. The claims that Scanian as a regional variety is a seperate language is supported only by Lång and a handful of Scanian regionalists who use completely bogus arguments  and often claim the name should be skåneländska (roughly ``Terra Scanian``). That it would be a dialect of only Danish is also extremely speculative, and it should at the very least be classified as simply ``East Scandinavian``.

From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHaving returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters.

He was a lawyer, member of the Philippine House of Representatives (1949–1959) and a member of the Philippine Senate (1959–1965). He was Senate President in 1963. He claimed to have led a guerrilla force called Ang Maharlika in northern Luzon during the Second World War, something much doubted however to be true.[1][2] As Philippine president and strongman, his greatest achievement was in the fields of infrastructure development and international diplomacy. However, his administration was marred by massive authoritarian corruption, despotism, nepotism, political repression, and human rights violations. He benefited from a large personality cult in the Philippines during his regime.[3] In 1983, his government was implicated in the assassination of his primary political opponent, Benigno Aquino, Jr.. The implication caused a chain of events, including a tainted presidential election that served as the catalyst for the People Power Revolution in February 1986 that led to his removal from power and eventual exile in Hawaii. It was later alleged that he and his wife Imelda Marcos had moved billions of dollars of embezzled public funds to the United States, Switzerland, and other countries, as well as into alleged corporations during his 20 years in power.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFerdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos was born September 11, 1917, in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte outside Laoag City to parents Mariano Marcos and Josefa Edralin. He was named after Ferdinand VII of Spain and baptized into the Philippine Independent Church. According to the Marcos family's oral history, the family name was originally Taguktok, and their Ilokano roots have some Japanese and Chinese ancestry. Ferdinand was a champion debater at the University of the Philippines, where he also participated in boxing, swimming and wrestling.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn December 1938, Mariano Marcos, his brother Pio, his son Ferdinand, and his brother-in-law Quirino Lizardo were prosecuted for the murder of Julio Nalundasan. On September 20, 1935, the day after Nalundasan (for the second time) defeated Mariano Marcos for the National Assembly seat for Ilocos Norte, Nalundasan was shot and killed in his house in Batac. According to two witnesses, the four had conspired to assassinate Nalundasan, with Ferdinand Marcos eventually doing the killing. In late January 1939, they were denied bail [4] and in the fall[when?] of 1939 they were convicted. Ferdinand and Lizardo received the death penalty for premeditated murder, while Mariano and Pio were found guilty only of contempt of court. The Marcos family took their appeal to the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which on October 22, 1940, overturned the lower court's decision and acquitted them of all charges but contempt.[5]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 1939, while incarcerated, Ferdinand Marcos graduated cum laude with a law degree from the U.P. College of Law. If he had not been put in jail for twenty seven days, he would have graduated magna cum laude. He was elected to the Pi Gamma Mu international honor society. While in detention, Governor Roque B. Ablan Sr. of Ilocos Norte helped Marcos study for the bar exams by providing a desk lamp in his cell, law books and reviewers. Marcos passed the bar examination with an almost perfect score of 98.01%, while also writing an 830-page defense. Several people contested his score and a retake was taken albeit an oral bar examination witnessed by several people. His second bar examination resulted in a 100% score, the highest grade obtained in the Philippine Bar).[6]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMarcos became senator after serving as member of the House of Representatives for three terms. In the Senate he served as minority floor leader before gaining the Senate presidency. He established a record for having introduced a number of significant bills, many of which found their way into the republic's statute books.[7]NEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] Personal lifeNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHe was married to Imelda Romualdez-Marcos, with four children: Maria Imelda ``Imee`` Marcos, Ferdinand ``Bongbong`` Marcos, Jr., Irene Marcos, and Aimee Marcos, who was adopted.NEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] PresidencyNEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] Administration and CabinetNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe cabinet appointments of President Marcos can be divided into three periods: his first two constitutional terms (1965–1973), the New Society appointments from 1973–1978, and the change from departments to ministries from 1978 to the end of his government.NEWLINE_TOKENOffice TAB_TOKENName TAB_TOKENTermNEWLINE_TOKENPresident TAB_TOKENFerdinand Marcos TAB_TOKEN1965–1973NEWLINE_TOKENVice-President TAB_TOKENFernando LopezNEWLINE_TOKENArturo Tolentino TAB_TOKEN1965–1973NEWLINE_TOKENFeb 16-25, 1986NEWLINE_TOKENPrime Minister TAB_TOKENCesar Virata TAB_TOKEN1981–1986NEWLINE_TOKENSecretary of Foreign Affairs TAB_TOKENCarlos P.

I'm not trying to be snarky; it's an honest question, because you seem to have a few misunderstandings about the process here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst, if you feel that anything in an article is inappropriate, whether it's the original text or a recent change, you can edit it. You don't have to ask me to ``reverse the changes``. There are still rules of editing etiquette that apply, such as not just ping-ponging changes back and forth (see WP:3RR), and being willing to discuss differences of opinion on talk pages like this. But no one owns the article - not me, not you; no one has veto power, except for administrators; and there's no reason to ask anyone in particular to make changes for you. It's not as if I wiped out your text forever: it's all in the article history, which is pretty easy to use.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, WP articles are not to be written based on what you or anyone else may think are ``very logical reasons`` to support a theory. It is fine to explain a particular person's or group's point of view on the subject, pro or con, as long as it's attributed clearly; but the encyclopedia itself is not in the business of saying what makes sense, and the purpose of the talk pages is not to argue about whether a theory is correct. Debates that might be very productive in the pages of a scientific journal are less so in an encyclopedia. This is particularly important when the theory has not yet reached wide acceptance as a scientific consensus - and I don't think you're claiming that it has. That is why I don't think the link from, for instance, SIV was appropriate; by stating that argument in the voice of the encyclopedia itself, it made it sound as if most researchers agree that this is a likely explanation. Again, see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view - one of the absolutely crucial WP rules.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThird, on a more trivial note, it is basic WP etiquette to log in under your username before you make edits or comments (so people can see who is doing what); to use the standard ``~~~~`` signature for your comments; and, when responding to a specific paragraph on a talk page, to indent your response immediately below it with ``:`` rather than copying and pasting the previous comment elsewhere.`",2006,True,user,random,test

Looking at the word ``perish`` in John 3:16, in Greek it is in neither active nor passive voice, but rather ``middle voice``, which means a better translation would be ``whoever does not believe in him will destroy himself``. Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God's love is sometimes described as a ``river of fire``. Hence both God's goodness and justice are preserved, as well as each person's free will.NEWLINE_TOKEN: * Also, Jesus did not have to die. To say that he was forced to die would imply that some external force or law is greater than God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death's power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like a steed.NEWLINE_TOKEN: * The Jews did not have to accept Jesus as their Messiah. He simply was their Messiah; it was not an elected office, and their choices did not change this fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection. Many Jews did believe in him, many more did not.NEWLINE_TOKEN: Hope this helps. I'll have to look another time at whether or how any of this should affect the article, as I'm obviously coming in very late to an old discussion.  17:15 Sep 9, 2002 (UTC)`",2002,True,article,random,train

210794210.0,3439,0,0.0,"NEWLINE_TOKEN:Kristof the problem here is a lag from the old Ukrainian orthography that has since changed. A similar case existed in Belarus, but much more amplified, when the changes of 1930s and subsequent orthographic reforms were very noticeable it affected the way whole cities were spelled. Example Minsk and Mensk. In fact that is the reason why there are two versions of Belarusian edition wikipedia, one uses the old and the other the official adopted version. In Ukrainian language a similar happened but to lesser extent, and only some cities were affected e.g. Rivne became Rovno, Luhanske became Luhansk, Konotip became Konotop and so on. With our city as far as I am aware it too became Мукачево. During the 1990s some of those changes were reversed, and it really falls to because in Ukrainian there are sufficient differences between dialects, in fact if you compare western and central Ukrainian the differences would be more vivid than that of British and American English. So for some cases like Rivne, it was much up to the locals, because Volhynian dialect pronounces the city like its spelled, whilst somewhere in Poltava they will say it as Rovno. It seems that with Mukhachevo it is a case that the version used by locals is not entirely adopted nationwide. But then again there are some silly people in the government who use spellings such as Sevatopil but that is outright stupid, because even in classic orthography that version would never be used. The -pil originates from the connotation of field like Ternopil. The -pol comes from the Greek root for city, like Sevastopol. All the more reasons why we should stick to Mukachevo and help to leave the archaic spelling where it belongs in history.  ",2008,True,article,random,train

Also, that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the Southern part of America during the civil war used to consider Blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. As a matter of fact, it was illegal for an Afro-American to go to school or even learn to read, since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners.

It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNext, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNot too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.

My research discovered many reviews and theatrical periodicals containg nothing but praise for the play and players.

You have both consistently  made very controversial and unfounded edits in this and similar articles based on your own agenda, yet you accuse others of doin the same without acknowledging your own ridiculous POV edits. I am not denying the link between Iberia and the British Isles but it is the same link shared across western and atlantic Europe and there is no special relationship with regards to those two respective regions. The relationship is only based on the Y-chromosome and Mtdna inheritance shared with all Western European regions. It needs to be reminded that there are subgroups to the r1b Y-chromosome marker and the regions have differential values in both y-chromosomes and mtdna. There is very little to no evidence of autosomal and x-chromosome analysis, and when viewing the y-chrom./mtdna percentages in these populations you need to look at them as a whole. R1b is found across western Europe in high frequencies, but it does not mean the populations are necessarily very related to each other. There is no genetic evidence yet of a Neolithic link between the British Isles and Iberia since R1b traces back to a Paleolithic Iberian refuge. The Neolithic and following periods were quite different between the Iberian and the British Isles and the Neolithic Y/chrom. and Mtdna percentage is much larger in Iberia than in Britain or Ireland. You also must not rely so significantly on references by Sykes or Oppenheimer since they have not brought any new genetic evidence to the subject and only cite studies in their books that have already been out for quite some time and are already found cited in these articles. I've read through both books and they really do make hasty, unfounded and biased conclusions that do not necessarily coincide with the results of the studies they refer so much to. There are also books already out, and also some to be released in the following months, which  contradict and refute many of the ``findings`` or ``conclusions`` of Oppenheimer and Sykes. Their views are also a minority among population geneticists and anthropologists because the majority acknoledge that many more studies on all sections of DNA need to be carried out to fully understand the origins of various peoples, let alone declaring any solid conclusions or findings. I do agree that I should discuss my edits when I make them and I will endeavour to do so from now on so it is easier to compromise on the fidings in this article.  `",2007,False,article,blocked,train

I realize that there was a book on Short published under the title, ``Severed`` (it's in my library, in fact).  But, if you look closely at the definition of ``sever``, Short's body wasn't really severed, it was cut in two.  Definition of ``sever`` from Webster's: to put or keep apart  divide; especially  to remove (as a part) by or as if by cutting.  To put or keep apart is accurate when referring to people who have severed relationships.  Divide; especially  to remove (as a part)... doesn't fit what happened to Short's body, because her body wasn't divided into parts but actually bisected.  With all of this in mind, I think that if ``severed`` is insisted on and kept, the words, ``in two`` need to be added.  I will be making that addition after I am finished with this talk page entry.

144795615.0,1386,0,1.0," (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Actually, most of the romance words in English come from Norman French, abit removed from French (especially modern French). Then there is another grouping of Latinate words which came in via the Grammar school boys (Grammar schools of the late medieval being schools which taught latin grammar, and which required students to speak grammar at all times), and the ecclesiastical coinages, from around the same period (late Tudor England onwards). The first lot, the Norman French, had a rather different historical journey from the second lot, the second lot being rather closer to Classical Latin (actually most are Church or Medieval latin, but the difference here is not so great). The Norman French borrowings have a little more fanciness than regular Germanic English because Norman French was the language of the English ruling class (and law etc) for about 300 years. Most the food words come through this path. The second group (borrowed in from about 1400 to 1700) are fancy not so much because they represent the ruling classes, but because they represent learning. Then there's a few other words which come in from other places, like Piano (from Italtian), and others which are similar because they actually come from a common germanic/italic root even a proto-Indo-European root.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think that it would be worth noting the path of derivation (NF vs Lating vs other).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn a second related point, the Germanic in English comes from several dialects, from both the North Germanic group (Norse) and the West Germanic. Old English had a few differing dialects. Northern English dialects tend to have a little more Norse and a little less Anglo-saxon, than the south-east. There are Norse and Saxon cognates which both made it into English, skirt and shirt being the famous examples. So, again some more information regarding the exact derivation of the Germanic, unless someone wants to go the whole hog and put in the proto-Germanic reconstructions.

(I don't know how many total editors were active in the last 30 days). While some admins involve themselves in setting policies (which anyone may participate in), others seem to confine themselves to truly janitorial work. For that reason I'm not sure if ``bureaucracy`` is the best way to describe the corps of admins, or the dangers threatened by their expansion. The more plausible fear, I think, is that too many admins will result in a ``police state``, with more sped-up deletes, heavy-handed blocks, and POV enforcement. I am certainly opposed to any movement in the direction of stifling unpopular POVs. I'm not sure that the number of admins is the major factor though. Another view, which I don't endorse either, is that having more admins broadens involvement and reduces the relative power of any one admin. I think that the most important issues are probably the rules and procedures, official and unofficial, that admins follow and/or enforce on others, Those powers should stay limited. - NEWLINE_TOKEN:NEWLINE_TOKEN:Also- Thanks for your support for my adminship.

Even Anna Nicole Smith had a few ``the lates`` put on pages of hers, and those have all been removed (a few by me, a few by others). ``Saving a click`` is not a valid reason for this, we should assume that the readers are smart, and things like that can go to the Simple English edition.NEWLINE_TOKEN:*Irrelevance - Why would the fact that he is dead be relevant to an article that talks about his programming?

For instance, while women have a demonstrated tendency towards agreeableness, this is likely true of most subordinated individuals.

The fact that psychometric research ``reinforces stereotypes`` does not show that the research is bad or wrong; instead, it supports the truth to these stereotypes. Whether women are Agreeable because of genetic or environmental reasons is irrelevant to the question of whether Agreeableness is a valid and universal psychomentric construct.

The Chameleon is a spy and master of disguise. Throughout his history, he has used a variety of traditional, high-tech and biologically enhanced ways to change his appearance, believably imitating almost anyone. He was also the ally, servant, and half-brother of fellow Spider-Man adversary Kraven the Hunter. His name is derived from the characters Dmitri and Smerdyakov from The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENContents •1 Publication history ◦1.1 Novels •2 Fictional character biography •3 Powers and abilities •4 Other versions ◦4.1 Chameleon 2211 ◦4.2 Counter-Earth ◦4.3 Ultimate Chameleon ◦4.4 Marvel Action Hour: Iron Man •5 In other media ◦5.1 Television ■5.1.1 The Marvel Superheroes Show ■5.1.2 Spider-Man (1981) ■5.1.3 Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends ■5.1.4 Spider-Man: The Animated Series ■5.1.5 The Spectacular Spider-Man ◦5.2 Video Games •6 References •7 External linksNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPublication history Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he initially appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #1 (March 1963), and was the first member of Spider-Man's vast rogues' gallery, based on issue publication date, excluding the burglar who murdered Ben Parker. (Supercharger was the first Spider-Man supervillain chronologically.[1])NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNovels The Chameleon had a vital role in the Sinister Six novel series by Adam-Troy Castro, in which the Gentleman, a long-lived supervillain and member of the Machiavelli Club (a gathering of some of the world's most sinister minds, including several non-Marvel characters) uses the new Sinister Six, of which the Chameleon is a member, as pawns in his schemes. Oddly enough, in this series he is referred to as Anatoly Smerdyakov. In the final novel in the series, Secret of the Sinister Six, the Gentleman betrays the villains and tries to escape; it is the Chameleon, to everybody's surprise, who kills the Gentleman, shooting the old man while disguised as a limousine driver and assuming his identity, only to be attacked by Dr. Octopus, thinking him to be the real Gentleman. Marvel has officially stated that the Sinister Six novels lay outside of normal continuity; however, these events have more recently been referenced in the Marvel handbooks. The Chameleon also plays the role of villain in the novel Goblin's Revenge. In this story, the Chameleon not only teams up with the murderous Carnage, but also attempts to drive Spider-Man insane by impersonating Norman Osborn (then thought to be dead and buried), and later trying to expose the web-slinger to a toxic chemical meant to destroy his mind.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFictional character biography The Chameleon was born a Russian citizen named Dmitri Smerdyakov. In his youth, he was a servant and half-brother to Kraven the Hunter, Sergei Kravinoff, and eventually became a minor associate to one Gustav Fiers. Although Dmitri and Sergei were friends, Sergei was often abusive to him, leading to a combination of admiration and resentment towards Kravinoff from Smerdyakov. Eventually, Smerdyakov emigrated to the United States of America. As he had made a talent for himself during his youth, impressing his brother by impersonating friends and neighbors, he assumed an even more impressive disguise: the identity of the Chameleon. During his first known criminal outing, he impersonated Spider-Man, though he was exposed and arrested. Shortly afterward, Kravinoff, now Kraven the Hunter, himself came to America, and the Chameleon set his old associate's sights on Spider-Man.[2] Both men became long-time enemies of Spider-Man, part of his primary rogues' gallery. The Chameleon inspired Kraven the Hunter to begin hunting Spider-Man, inviting Kraven to dispose of the hero.[3] With Kraven, the Chameleon then battled Iron Man.[4] Chameleon then confronted the Hulk.[5] The Chameleon stole some paintings from an art exhibit, but was thwarted by Spider-Man.[6] The Chameleon disguised himself as Henry Pym, and robbed Pym's laboratory for documents to combat Virus Nine. He delivered the documents and a shrunken Hulk to HYDRA, but was defeated by the real Pym as Ant-Man.[7] The Chameleon disguised himself as the Torpedo and battled Daredevil.[8] The Chameleon later first used his hologram belt to disguise himself to unsuccessfully take revenge on Spider-Man.[9] When Kraven the Hunter committed suicide,[10] the Chameleon became obsessed with making Spider-Man suffer for his failure to prevent Kraven from killing himself.

270214493.0,890,0,0.0,"`::::::Noren, your argument is ridiculous. Only a very few atoms (helium, neon, and argon) have TRULY filled electron shells, and can participate in energy-releasing fusion.  The reference is making generic statements, so that it specifies ``light nuclei`` instead of particular elements.  It does not need to say HOW filled an electron shell is, when making generic remarks about light nuclei.  It DOES specifically state, ``In normal conditions between atoms or molecules, the nuclei never get close enough for fusion to commence``.  And all of us here know that the conditions of CF are far more normal than stellar.  Regarding the other stuff in my last post, I do know that it is OR and was not trying to get it into the article at this time (it won't be OR forever).  I just wanted to point out to Art, who brags about his Phd, that he's the one who is dead wrong about electron shells being in the way.  I recall reading about the shells being in the way about 4 decades ago, when I first started learning stuff about fusion.  It was the very first thing that came to my mind, as a problem to solve, when I first heard about cold fusion.  It is silly to not mention this problem in the article here.  IS there a conspiracy by CF-detractors, to keep any data out of the article that might someday become related used to the solutions to the main problems?  Why else would Art do his latest lie-of-omission, trying to talk about real nuclei under real-world conditions without paying any attention to the electrons that were associated with those nuclei?  The SUN does not fly apart, all its temperature-freed nuclei receding to infinite distance under the influence of mutual electric repulsion (which would indeed happen if there were no electrons in the mix).

There's no need to lecture me on wp, thanks for the offer tho - this is the first time that I have seen such aggressive uninformed editing in years. I was not at all trying to ``own`` the article, what I was trying is making sure that informed edits go through. In case you didn't notice, I previously asked for the article to be LOCKED for public editing, to lock out certain people (including myself!), to ensure that only a handful of people with a demonstrated background in aviation can review edits, while others could help with stylistic stuff and proper refs/quoting. At the end of the day, I have given up now - and I won't bother wasting any more time debating things here, as usual, interest will degrade over time and some jackass-type personalities will probably remove themselves sooner or later (probably the ones who just happen to be around accident-related articles because of recent news coverage) - at the moment, there's simply too much public interest, and what's happening isn't just a wp-specific issue, there's lots of layman's discussion taking place everywhere, without really adding to the quality of discussion. Finally, what's been happening here wouldn't be tolerated in a commercial environment with professional editors, where responsibility has to be assigned to individuals, encyclopedic or not. Again, this is nothing personal and against anybody here - I do realize that there are team dynamics at work here, and I have seen tons of editing wars going on here, not just due to my own edits - so I really don't take it personally. But I would hope for wikipedia to adopt some sort of policy, workflow and procedures for such ``hot`` events, to ensure a higher degree of QA - not just based on wp seniority/status, but based on people who have some related professional background. wp isn't going to fail obviously, but 5-10 years from now, the behavior tolerated here by some ``wannabe-experts`` will no longer be tolerated, and corresponding procedures will be put in place to differentiate between content and markup contributions.

653360922.0,4053,0,1.0,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:First of all, reverting your edit wasn't a challenge to whether or not the information was correct. It was purely based on the lack of a citation. Wikilinks are not acceptable substitutions for inline citations. Each article must be able to stand on its own set of references and not rely on a wikilink to another article's reference. Refer to WP:CITE for more information. Secondly, comparing the flags and drawing a conclusion – no matter how reasonable and obvious it might be – can be considered a form of original research which is not permitted on Wikipedia. Citing a reliable source that supports the analogy alleviates the concern. It also helps us establish the significance of the information as it relates to the topic. Without that verification, it may be a trivial observation that doesn't necessarily belong in this article (see WP:DUE). As for your ``sky is blue`` analogy, it's an apples-to-oranges comparison. Take for example the statement that ``the Eiffel Tower is in Paris``. This is widely accepted fact that doesn't require research, and therefore doesn't require a citation. However, the statement that ``Gustave Eiffel designed the Eiffel Tower`` would need a citation, although it is easily verifiable. It may be hard to see the difference, but the rule of thumb is when you think it may be challenged, it's best to err on the side of caution and include a citation.   `",2015,True,article,random,test

Don't feel too badly; lots of people have a little trouble when creating their first article.

Two important rules of thumb are: Avoid  writing about yourself, your business, your family and friends, or your web page, and avoid writing about anything that hasn't been written about in reliable sources like books, newspapers, and magazines.  Anyway, don't be discouraged.  I've deleted the article you created, and feel free to ask me if you have any more questions.  If I've made a mistake, and this article really is about a subject that meets the notability criteria, then please let me know my leaving me  and links to at least three newspaper articles, magazine articles, or books that have been written about the subject, and I'll be glad to undelete it, and even add the sources so no other patroller makes the same mistake.  -  ·  `",2010,True,user,random,train

The reason I find it necessary to do this is because some elements of Chang's story, which report claims of the DI have been blithely elevated to facthood, without benefit of a critical examination of the reported claims.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHere is my initial draft for the new section, to appear below the biography and above the discussion of the controversial DI petition.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Controversial New York Times Story==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn February 2006, the New York Times ran an investigative story Few Biologists but Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition by Kenneth Chang of the New York Times Science Desk, reporting that the Discovery Institute had launched a new websiteDissent From Darwin to promote their expanded public relations campaign regarding how theories of evolution should be taught in public school.  The new website included a list of signatories to an earlier petition which the Discovery Institute had termed ``A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism.``Signatories of 'A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism' The petition dated back to 2001 when it was first published by the Discovery Institute beneath an ad criticizing a forthcoming PBS series on evolution.2001 ``100 Scientists`` Ad]  The headline on the Discovery Institute's 2001 ad was also ``A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism,`` although the petition itself, embedded at the bottom of the ad, did not carry that label (it bore no label at all).  The untitled 2001 version of the petition simply read, ``We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENChang's story disclosed that Professor Picard's name appeared on the petition cited by the newly launched Dissent From Darwin website, but the Times article did not distinguish which version she signed.  Indeed, Professor Picard's name first appeared on the original 2001 untitled two-sentence petition and her name remained on the subsequent controversially yclept versions, including the most recent one appearing on the new website.  Chang's story neither substantiated nor refuted the claims of the Discovery Institute that the two-sentence petition supported or endorsed DI's slant on its meaning, but the story did include a mixture of quotes from some of the people whose names appeared on the list at different times, including some quotes that cast doubt on the Discovery Institute's characterization of all the petition signers as variously ``dissenters from Darwinism`` or ``anti-evolution.``  Chang's story, in conjunction with the Discovery Institute's website and its attached list of petition signers left a wake of confusion over who among the list of signers of the earlier versions of the petition agreed with or consented to the Discovery Institute's characterization of the petition signers as ``anti-evolution`` ``dissenters`` who presumably supported the emerging and evolving agenda of the Discovery Institute.  It is at present unknown to what degree, if any, Picard agrees with or supports the Discovery Institute's controversial interpretation of the petition as ``dissent.``  It is also unknown whether Picard has ever supported any or all of the ongoing political agenda of the Discovery Institute.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe last two sentences of the proposed new section reflect the absence of verifiable published information regarding the attitude of most of the original 103 signers.  So far, Wikipedia has only managed to obtain a reliably sourced comment from Stanley N. Salthe, who disputed DI's characterization and supplied his own salty attitude, ``A plague on both their houses.``  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSkip Evans of the NSCE similarly casts doubt on the DI's interpretation, sayingNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe StatementNEWLINE_TOKENThe signatories appear to attest to a statement about the ability of natural selection to ``account for the complexity of life`` - in other words, a statement about how evolution t",2007,True,article,blocked,train

NEWLINE_TOKEN:I have no idea what Vietnam Advance Software Company is, why? And who cares what country I'm in? A) I happen to live in Vietnam, I don't see why that should make it strange if I express my views on certain wiki pages. If you don't believe me, feel free to read my blog: http://www.morethan3words.blogspot.com/ (sorry for the shameless plug, but I've been told I should self-promote more). And B) I actually am not defending the CIA, I've taken up the article as a pet project to learn more about how to use Wikipedia and interact with the wiki community before I take on bigger projects next spring. The views I express are not in defense of the CIA, but are actually in any effort to improve the CIA main page and make it more neutral and accurate. (  )NEWLINE_TOKEN::I have no idea what Vietnam Advance Software Company is, why?NEWLINE_TOKEN::Because the IP you used before you created this account was from Vietnam Advance Software Company.

I applaud you for not deleting this section as some people do. NEWLINE_TOKEN::It is harder, but much more productive to do this:  Counterpoints are welcome, and make the article stronger. Read the references provided and see if these articles are accurately written about in the CIA article. Editors and fact checkers on  wikiarticles are severely needed. NEWLINE_TOKEN::I welcome your input into these sections. I look forward to working with you more.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:::I think you have a slight misconception of my motives for moving the sections. Actually, I am not suggesting moving these sections because I actually DISAGREE with any of them, on the contrary, I have no basis to refute any of them. I think they should be moved to their own article because the topic, i.e., operations of the CIA, is so large and comprehensive it should have its own article. Furthermore, the CIA main page is too unwieldy as it is. Actually, under the current form, I think it discourages people from reading about the operations because it's simply too much text, placed after they have already read an extensive amount about the CIA history, organization, etc. Counterpoints won't do any good but to make the page MORE complicated and unwieldy. You're right, fact checking is important for these sections, but also very difficult to adequately accomplish for even seasoned jouranlists and academitions. This only furthers my point that it is something that should not take place on the CIA main page because it will inherently cause the page to be in too much constant flux and flow. (  )NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Although you argue that you are not a defender of the actives CIA, I personally think the way you describe the criticism section of the CIA  as  and  show a clear POV bias. NEWLINE_TOKEN::::You are in good company. Thus far, every single one of the editors who want this section moved are conservatives with clear POV bias, which is seen in their edits and edit warring.

There are, however, some obvious problems with the article's current text. Several statements are unsourced or improperly sourced, and editorial opinions and recommendations are given. I don't think there can be any justification for including editorialising like ``The unfortunate history of the genus now came to play`` or leading statements like ``The reader can decide for themselves whether the issue here is 'science' or just 'politics', and whether there is any solid factual basis for rejecting Wells' name for this taxon``. We can only repeat or report what the sources say. In this case, we can state for instance that Georges and Thomson (2010) concluded that Wells' publication did not fulfil the criteria for publication under the ICZN, and that they disputed whether ``W. dorsei`` warranted recognition as a separate species. I have seen similar cases elsewhere, with statements like ``this constitutes a valid publication under the ICZN[1]``, where the citation is to the ICZN itself (which naturally doesn't mention the case in question) – this is to my mind obviously unacceptable. On less contentious issues, how many species are there in the genus? We learn that the ``genus currently contains five [...] species``, but only four are listed. I would also recommend removing the Wikispecies link until it provides complementary information, rather than a blank contradiction.

She said in many cases people were detained simply for being alleged members of groups that do not like Americans.  Green quoted extensively from the tribunal proceeding against Mustafa Ait Idir, 34, an Algerian living in Bosnia who was accused of plotting with others to blow up a U.S. embassy there. Idir noted that a Bosnian court found no evidence against him and repeatedly but unsuccessfully asked tribunal officials to present their evidence that he was an al Qaeda fighter. He argued he could not prove a negative, and that he would hit a person who claimed he was a terrorist in the face, which prompted the tribunal members to laugh. The exchange ``might have been truly humorous had the consequences of the detainee's 'enemy combatant' status not been so terribly serious and had the detainee's criticism of the process not been so piercingly accurate,`` the judge wrote. `",2005,True,article,random,train

The fact that he threatens to tag anyone who replaces the comments and criticisms section as a vandal is obvious, and can be seen as an abuse of admin power, voting is the generally accepted way of resolving these disputes yet he has completely ignored this and used his admin power to forward his personal agenda surrouding this article.

One of the reasons for this, among others, is that interrogational astrology (ie. horary) was not developed until the 2nd and 3rd centuries and this development occurred in India within the Hindu tradition. (See Pingree, 1996, pg. 21)  Horary was not a part of the mainstream tradition of Hellenistic astrology from which Ptolemy and his contemporaries were drawing on, and it did not become integrated into the western tradition of horoscopic astrology until the Middle Ages when the various Arab and Persian astrologers undertook a synthesis of the Indian, Persian and Hellenistic traditions.

So here is what I propose: zero article in the lead (and anywhere else where we are talking about the brand), but normal usage throughout the rest of the article, where appropriate. So ``The iPod is associated with one host computer,`` would remain the same since it's talking about the product and not the brand. This way we can maintain a grammatically euphonious format throughout, and not have to awkwardly restructure sentences to stay in line with Apple-speak.

88790315.0,1778,0,0.0,"`==Rory==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIs her son reading PPE, Modern History, or Modern History and Politics (MHP)? All three have been mentioned (including the non-existent ``history and politics and history``). It is sometimes the case that an admissions tutor might suggest that a candidate accepts a place for a subject other than that for which he or she has applied, although I think that is most likely to happen when the candidate has applied for a Joint School and is thought to be better suited to just one of the subjects it includes, e.g. an applicant for Philosophy and Theology might be offered Theology (there is no School of Philosophy); I suppose it is possible that it was doubted whether he was suitably qualified to read the philosophy and economics aspects of the course and, since there is no School of Politics, it would be possible only to offer a Joint School including politics, of which the only one currently offered is MHP (presumably he would have been considered well qualified for Modern History). It isn't the case that PPE is more ``coveted`` (or even ``coverted``!) than MHP; rather, that more applicants aspire to read it. I suppose those applicants (and later those who were unsuccessful) do covet reading PPE, but I imagine that MHP applicants covet a place to read MHP. Perhaps PPE is quantitively more coveted, but I think that unless MHP students secretly covet the opportunity of reading PPE, it isn't really an appropriate description. All that might be said is that PPE is long-established and is currently thought to be a good preparation for future life. When the PPE School was in its infancy it was regarded as a very poor School, though not as poor as English Language and Literature, about which it was commonly asked whether one could really justify a university teaching English literature (English language was less controversial, which is why the early course placed such great emphasis on language rather than literature) - one might say that English was the old media studies. Today, English is considered one of the most respectable university degree subjects. Modern History used to be considered second after Literae Humaniores and is still a highly respected School (in fact, all Schools at Oxford are highly respected, notwithstanding criticism sometimes directed against Classical Archaeology and Ancient History). Presumably the earlier information about Rory Campbell reading MHP was incorrect, or he has managed to change his course, which is not uncommon, although it would seem strange for a student to be allowed to change to a course for which he or she had previously been rejected.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIs it actually important to mention that Fiona Millar's son is reading PPE at Balliol? Many hundreds of people have read PPE at Balliol, so it is hardly a thing of any interest in itself. Perhaps if Fiona Millar had previously been an opponent of PPE (very unlikely), or of Oxford (or Oxbridge) (a distinct possibility), or indeed of Balliol (unlikely but a remote possibility), it would be of interest. However, nothing in the article suggests that she holds, or has ever held, anti-Oxford/Oxbridge views. If the suggestion being made was that her son had gained admission to Balliol because of the importance of his parents and in spite of being ``widely regarded as a top class idiot``, I would think that the allegation is unkind, probably unfounded, and almost certainly impossible to prove. The only way in which it could be included here would be if it was stated in some other source, such as a newspaper article. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`",2006,True,article,blocked,train

By the 4th century bc, it had extended its rule northward into the Balkan Peninsula and throughout the Mediterranean. In the 2nd century bc, Macedonia was made into a Roman province. When the Roman Empire was divided in the 4th century ad into eastern and western halves, Macedonia became part of the eastern half, which became the Byzantine Empire.

The Paeonians, who were probably of mixed Thraco-Illyrian origin, were weakened by the Persian invasion (490 bc), and those tribes living along the Strymon River (in western Bulgaria) fell under Thracian control. The growth of Macedonia forced the remaining Paeonians northward, and in 358 bc they were defeated by Philip II of Macedonia. The native dynasty, however, continued to be highly respected: about 289 bc, King Audoleon received Athenian citizenship, and his daughter married Pyrrhus, king of Epirus.

The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is ``covered up`` by people and also people often refer to it as the ``Nazi-Soviet`` pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand ``Nazi`` and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as ``Nazis`` (they did not refer to themselves as ``Nazis``).  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as ``It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!``  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word ``Nazi`` to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase ``National Socialist.`` The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand ``Nazi`` even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment ``Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!``   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name ``Union of Soviet Socialist Republics`` and also used the term ``Communist`` instead of using the term ``Socialist.``  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether the salutes dictated particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired ``Nationalism`` clubs worldwide including in Germany. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN    Yes, the ``Roman salute`` page did once contain innaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to start going on with his use of the term ``conspiracy.`` It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN    The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who ``became wiser``, by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Dr. Curry has also publicly challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues.  Professor Curry's discovery that the swastika/hakenkreuz, although an ancient symbol, was sometimes used by the National Socialist German Workers' Party as ``S`` shapes standing for its ``Socialism`` is also his own original work.

It's all very nice to be able to laugh and say ``you're wrong on all these points``, but in fact this section is misrepresenting Wicca just as much as the Harry-haters.NEWLINE_TOKEN*The heading itself seems to imply that witchcraft and Wicca are synonymous. Wicca is merely one variety of modern witchcraft.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Wiccans commune with the dead and the spirit world. At Halloween (or Samhain), for example, we invite the spirits of our ancestors and deceased loved ones to return and share our warmth and companionship for an evening. Extensive spirit contact by Wiccans (via ouija board and channeling) is recounted in A Voice in the Forest by Jimahl diFiosa, an Alexandrian High Priest.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Sorcery: well, Wiccans definitely perform magic. The word 'sorcery' has a sinister sound to it, which perhaps doesn't fit with Wicca so well, but if it merely means 'performing magic', then certainly.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Occult symbology: this is merely a catch-all phrase for anything that looks a bit 'occult', isn't it? Well, Wicca is very definitely 'occultism', since it deals with magic and the hidden parts of reality. And yes, Wiccans use occult symbols, such as zodiacal signs.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Curses are of course forbidden in Wicca, as is all malicious or harmful magic.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Demon posession: Whoever accused Wiccans of practicing demon posession is pulling a swift one. Wiccans practice what could loosely be called ``posession``: calling our God or Goddess into the body of a priest or priestess. I guess this is fairly similar to what Christians call ``being filled with the spirit``, but if you happen to consider the Wiccan gods to be demons (and of course they're demons, aren't they, since any deity other than Jehovah is a demon), then you could term this ``demon possession``, feeling only a tinge of guilt at your verbal chicanery.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe real reason why Harry Potter has nothing to do with Wicca is because Harry Potter is fantasy, presented in a manner that has virtually no resemblance to the reality of modern witchcraft, whether it be Wicca or any other variety.

497622585.0,896,0,1.0,"`NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::Ok, the argument regarding the Brandenburg class is this: What distinguishes the Dreadnought type from a pre-Dreadnought? As I understand it from the article the only requirement is the uniform main battery in bore diameter and barrel length. There is a whole list what the advantages are and the only ones the Brandenburg class did not meet due to the different barrel length is maximum range (the difference is nearly irrelevant in 1890 due to fire control abilities) muzzle velocity and thus flight time and splash distinction (irrelevant because of the low number of differing guns and the missing central fire control at this time). Dreadnought labeled ships had 6 inch guns as secondary armament while the Brandenburg had only 4 inch ones as next biggest after the main guns. The maximization of striking power on long range has to be seen in the context of the time, the long range is the maximum of guns and fire control, also the power of HE does not depend on muzzle velocity but on caliber (as used in the article, which was the same for all of the 6 guns) and even the Japanese used HE 15 years later with their big guns...NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::The other advantages of the armament rest on ``caliber`` as used in the article (see ``#Main armament power and caliber``), not on barrel length, like logistical simplicity. The fire control advantage from splashes is there for only 6 guns, and if 2 shells arrive even a bit later, it is even better for distinguishing shots with the non-central firecontrol in use at this time. The rate of fire was uniform and about 2 shells per minute as stated in the Brandenburg article, no problem there as well.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::What about the rest of the design features of Dreadnought according to the article? Central fire control was not implemented in all the ``Dreadnought types`` and if it was used, then to very different degrees. The position of the main armament on the Dreadnought itself was not optimal with the wing turrets, the Brandenburg was more advanced with only centerline turrets. That there were problems like the blast damage was not uncommen, Dreadnought ships had wet guns and so on as well. The armor was undergoing heavy changes before and after the Dreadnought, the Brandenburg class had composite armour, the all-or-nothing scheme came later than Dreadnought and the armor deck (plunging fire) was thicker on Brandenburg than on the Dreadnought 15 years later. The turbine was not used by early US Dreadnoughts and coal was used on much later British ships.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::Interesting how ships not even having the same caliber (as in the article without barrel length) are mentioned as being semi-dreadnoughts and the Brandenburg class 15 years earlier only lacking the uniform barrel length but coming much closer to the ``Dreadnought description`` in many other aspects than actual early Dreadnought is totally omitted...   `",2012,True,user,random,test

While it was established as a railroad terminus, it didn't exist by itself.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 1860 Fulton County had a total of 14,427 people.  There were 2955 enslaved African-Americans, 20.5% of the population.  While much of north GA had mostly yeoman farmers, both Cobb and Fulton County also had planters (defined by historians as holding 20 or more slaves), who held slaves for labor on large cotton plantations. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(I know more about Roswell in Cobb county, than Fulton, but the origins of major planters and the slaves they brought with them are likely similar. Roswell King and planters he invited to join him in his enterprise (at what became Roswell) were from the coast. King brought 36 slaves from his coastal plantation and bought another 42 at Darien, GA, to take with him to work on building his house, the mill, and supporting buildings. Archibald Smith brought 36 slaves with him from his coastal plantations in St. Marys County and created a 300-acre cotton plantation in Roswell. King's idea was to have cotton production AND  processing in the same place.

The VP was something of a freak - who was it aimed at in marketing terms and did anyone ever associate Allegros with luxury motoring? It was probably produced because Ford was having big success with the Ghia versions of some of its models, upgraded and laden with extras for which a premium price was charged, and cash-strapped BL was desperate for some of the action. The reason for raising this is that VPs weren't actually badged as Austins (or Allegros for that matter), but sold as a separate marque albeit through the same BL dealderships,so the pic shouldn't appear on the Austin history page cos it isn't.

You can censor me and block me all you want – you’ve got the power – but you can’t make me confess to wrongs of which I am innocent. Not yet, anyway. And you can’t make me say that you’re right, when you are as wrong as hell. It’s about time somebody talked back to you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“If you were to discuss your edits, you won't [sic] be in this position right now.” (Since I had already discussed my edits, physicq’s statement above is a case of “a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood.”)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat’s funny peculiar, because wikicensors with the correct politics somehow never have to “discuss” their “edits.” They just go and censor people with whom they disagree, and then demand that the censees justify the worth of the censored passages or links or footnotes. And guess what? The censees’ explanations, no matter how well-founded and eloquent, are never sufficient to make the censors change their minds. Once an editor realizes that nothing he says will have any positive effect on the censors (or should I say, ``commissars``?), he would be a fool to waste his time and energy trying to change that which cannot be changed. That the censors continue demanding such arguments is because they have a sadistic glee for wasting other people’s precious time and energy.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn case an open-minded (but perhaps less experienced) reader should suspect that I am just engaging in bluster, I had already made my argument in my previous entry on this page (which AuburnPilot has archived in a handsome tan box at the bottom of  under the uncivil category, “spam”) for why the footnotes and links I inserted were legitimate, but physicq aka physicq210 derided those arguments as a “polemic, complete with fallacious personal attacks,” and mocked my criticism of his abuse of authority as “whining.” In one case, I pointed out that the external link that AuburnPilot defamed as “spam” and censored, was a classic magazine article related to the  Racial Profiling Hoax.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(Speaking of which, Wikipedia's Racial profiling article is hopelessly POV through the censors’ deleting of links to articles debunking the hoax, and inserting of links to fraudulent “literature” such as thoroughly debunked work by the ACLU.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the case of a footnote that AuburnPilot also defamed as “spam” and censored, he cut the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the  Duke Rape Hoax, which was published by the most brilliant, reliable magazine on the Web, VDARE.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBTW, AuburnPilot asserts that the sources in question are not “reliable” or “verifiable,” and do not maintain “neutrality.” Aside from the fact that thousands of Wikipedia articles are transparent political propaganda, or no more than love or hate letters to certain public figures (particularly entertainers or athletes), AuburnPilot has misrepresented the Wikipedia rule on neutrality. There is no requirement that every source be neutral (as opposed to reliable and verifiable), only that every Wikipedia article be neutral.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWP:NPOVNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by a reliable source.

If I have already made my best argument for including the aforementioned links and footnotes, and physicq aka physicq210 responds by misrepresenting what I said, claiming that I have made no attempt at supporting my position, and referring to my defense as “whining,” what possible reason could I have for continuing such a charade?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlus, why should I be on the defensive?

The archaeologists did not find evidence of cannibalism at Alder Creek, but this is easily explainable. Further, the Alder Creek digs say nothing about other incidents of cannibalism by Donner Party members at the lake camp, among the ``Forlorn Hope`` snowshoers, or at Starved Camp. Survivors said they ate human flesh and rescuers saw the evidence. Donner Party cannibalism is not in doubt among anyone who is familiar with the incident; it's the general public who have misinterpreted the archaeological evidence as ``casting doubt`` on cannibalism. DPL, 6/28/2007NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCannibalism in the Donner Party is not in question. Ten survivors said they ate human flesh. At the Donner family camp at Alder Creek, the Donners told the First Relief that they were going to start eating the bodies of the dead; when the Second Relief arrived at Alder Creek they saw children eating human flesh and mutilated corpses. Three Alder Creek survivors (Georgia Donner, Mary Donner, and Jean-Baptiste Trudeau) said that cannibalism had occurred at the Donner camp. This is not a legend, but a matter of record. People who are unfamiliar with the historical sources are not competent to dismiss them as ``legends.`` Kristin Johnson, author Unfortunate Emigrants: Narratives of the Donner Party (Logan: Utah State University Press, 1996).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a little footnote I'd like to add that cannibalism WAS a big part of the story. The website that is footnoted on that sentence shows about 6 episodes of eating people. Some of them ate human flesh for a month! And even the site admits it's a ``brief`` section of their crazy feeding habits! Donner is forever known for eating others and the fact that it wasn't just 1 or 2 bodies, but like approx. 7-8+? really shows that these people had an appetite for homoerectus!   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:As a little footnote, I'd like to add that you don't know what you're talking about. A year elapsed between the time the emigrants left home and the day the last survivor was rescued. With one exception, those who ate human flesh did so for about 2 weeks, some for as little as 2-3 days. Two weeks, out of 52 weeks in a year, IS minor. They did NOT ``develop an appetite for homo erectus`` or a ``crazy eating habit``  they put off eating human flesh for as long as they could, until finally there was absolutely nothing else left to eat. The reason why ``Donner is known forever for eating others`` is because the general public, like the commentator above, exults in its own ignorance.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would like to point out they weren't eating homo erectus, but homo sapien. lol.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn all fairness, I would like to further point out that they were actually eating Homo Sapien's erectus. To my knowledge, this is the only story in American history where a group resorts to eating other members of the group to survive. Supposedly the first to die were murdered for their meat. That makes the cannibalism portion of their journey understandably popular.  I would have eaten maybe a shouldercock, but that's it.

67561956.0,941,0,0.0,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCash I am a walmart assocate and I do feel there is a link between Walmart managment and servant leadership, and here is why. The managers are not in charge of the store, the hourly associates are, they take orders directly from the customers. The customers are consitered under walmarts policies to be the boss, the hourly assocates are next in that order and so on. This is a backwards model that was set fourth by Sam Walton himself and is maintained by the current board. Grassroots survays are conducted every 3mos to a year, this survey is a rating of each manager, and is then reviewed by the district and Regional VP, then changes are made. Each level of management must answer to the hourly assocates, and so it is kinda a push/pull managment system. Take my own situation for an example. heres what happend, one night I am short of assocates in the deli(which is where I work) Temp logs did not get done, of course this is a major mistake, I was ``written up`` for this. However I did not feel this was fair, so I wrote an email to our district manager explaining the situation, he then forwarded the matter to our regional VP. Our VP came to our store, flew in from bentonville mind you. To deal with the situation, he met with me for about an hour and also met with some other deli assocates. After a week he calls me and tells me that he can not get rid of the Written warning, however that all of the managers that had been informed that we where short, would be on probation for the next six months. I was satisfied with the outcome Because, While I was not fault free in the situation, management however was informed that I did not have enough people to help customers and deal with the food safty logs, and they failed to act accordingly and I was not happy with it, so in the end I punished them for their poor perfomance. So you can kinda see why they consiter it a servant leadership. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso Cash I hate the way you term 'vast left-wing conspiracy' I am myself a liberal and we liberals are not part of that conspiracy ideal, that would be your union leaders and right-wing large business owners, that are anti-walmart, As much as you would like to identify us liberals with the unions we are in no way assocated with them, infact most of us liberals dislike the unions just as much if not more then you right-wingers. Because the general public tends to identify unions with the democratic party and this is because most union voters, vote on the liberal side, this does not mean that they are liberals, just that they play the politics game. True liberals hate the unions and feel that they are just as bad or worse then a currupt big business. With a currupt big business atleast you know what they are and they make no bones about it, with a union they want to be your friend and then screw you. lol.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn the part about this entry being POV it is very much so POV however I have given up tring to balance it out myself the Anti-Walmart people always revert your edit and then threaten to get you banned for the three revert rule when you attempt to make any edits, its a freaking joke the way they act.

Wikipedia is MORE than that, because it is not subject to the constraints that have bound traditional encyclopedias.  Size is irrelevant; I've got a half terabyte external USB drive on the Linux server across the room that is smaller and lighter than a paperback (well, Cryptonomicon at least).  Assuming good bitonal TIFF document images, that will hold 5 million scanned pages; assuming moderately compact text files (PalmOS reader format) that jumps to 250 million pages.  Printing costs are also irrelevant, since it's not printed, as are writing costs (monetary and temporal), as the labor force is both free and unbounded in size.  So it's back to first principles...NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::The definition of ``encyclopedia`` is a book or set of books containing articles on various topics, usually in alphabetical arrangement, covering all branches of knowledge or, less commonly, all aspects of one subject (Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1)).  Since Wikipedia is unbound by the constraints of other encyclopeidas, then I truly believe that it should cover all branches of knowledge, and cover them far more thoroughly than has heretofore been possible.  As far as sysadmin topics go, Wikipedia failed me this week; if the article on Domain Name System had even so much as a link to resolv.conf, I could have save myself a lot of digging when I set up that Linux system.  In fact, I'll probably do just that, along with showing the file format of resolv.conf to that article, now that I've figured it out.  Why?  Because it's useful information that I needed and failed to find when I looked for it.  It's not quite ``narrating the process``, but it certainly is within the scope of an article on the DNS process to describe the steps taken by each part, and one of those steps would be ``the client checks the list of DNS servers (see resolv.conf etc.) to determine which name server to consult``; that's all I would have needed to find the information I needed to solve my problem.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::As Jimmy Wales said, Our goal...is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. ...empowering people everywhere to have the information they need to make good decisions.

My solution would be to rank using the lowest common denominator; case in point:  some sources say GI Joe cost $170m, and some $175m, but while the figures don't match they both agree that the film cost at least $170m.  In view of that, my suggestion would be to rank off the lower amount, but include the higher amount as an alternative estimate.

Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the ``Speedy Deletion`` I could find no such option.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.

425233318.0,3183,0,0.0,"`::: Cparker, I don't know what you did after 2006, but if anyone else has this kind of issue, I would suggest you consider the lap band instead. It does not require the drastic re-sectioning of your organs that is done in roux en y/gastric bypass. In the surgery, you lose more than a foot of your small intestine that you can't get back and that is necessary if it is connected to the stomach in its normal position; the area where that connection originally occurred is closed off by sutures; the area of your stomach that is stapled creates a bifurcated stomach that cannot be reopened - it is completely irreversible. This is a complete and permanent lifestyle and physiological change that should never be taken lightly. See my comments in other comment sections on this page about about the difference between your pre- and post-surgical life. You will be on a diet for life - you will not be returning to your prior eating habits, and as I mention above, you may not even want to. Your tastebuds will change. Your nutritional needs will be re-prioritized. You still have to actively pursue the weight loss - it isn't that they cut your stomach down and you eat what you want and lose weight - that is not how it works at all. You will be nauseated after the surgery - mine lasted for the two and a half months during which I was on pureed food only - I begged people to pray for me, it was so bad, but once I was back on solid food, it went away. That may have been unique to me. There are many problems that occur with everyone, but some will be unique to you. My program made me do 6 months of supervised 1,500 calorie a day diet and exercise (as much as I could with other conditions hampering me), and prior to that my PCP and I tried a similar program ourselves. So there is no ``trying it out`` - you are either in the program or not. But I can tell you, after almost a decade of obesity caused by medications I take for other conditions (and to be honest, exacerbated by over-eating for the first time in my life, also a side-effect of those meds), I have lost about 55 lbs. in the 5 months since my surgery. Seeing the scale keep going down and down is a good feeling. With the surgery, it happens quickly at first and then slows down, with the lap band it's just the opposite. Make sure you are totally informed before you make a choice, and choose your surgeon and their program wisely. Do your homework. Plus, they have screening methods, also, to make sure you are not wasting their time. You will be given a psychological evaluation - similar to having plastic surgery - to make sure you understand the risks, the benefits, the amount of involvement you play in your weight loss journey, and if you are ready for it.

But your characterization of my attitude and what I respect and don't is to say the least dubious. Did it occur to you that I didn't attend your schools, have different experiences, different parents, and can think for myself? There is plenty of room for differences in interpretation, as anyone that has mediated flame wars here, as I have can tell you. One cranky old editor spouting off does NOT make for a battle. OTOH, similar frank opinions have almost universally in the past resulted in a good working relationship, a clear communication, and about 3/4ths of the time, resulted in a new Wikifriend. So piffle to WP:CIVyou're not looking at the context, nor the intent of the context for that guideline. Being polite can in fact be counterproductive and a time waste, a matter of judgmentmine, as the observer. Take Quiddity (who signed up at page top for example) who once demonstrated a unbelievable tendency to pro-offer unwarranted judgments and unsolicited advice. Ultimately, I had to get firm with him and sent this, which he threatened to post, SO I DID. Nothing there to be ashamed of, you see. Bottom line... there are some people in this world that need rapped along side the ear to get their attention. There are others that need to have their toes stepped on, UNTIL THEY APOLOGIZE. Both those types benefit some by being jerked up by the shorthairs. Failing all else, it makes me feel better, and communicates at least one person, however crazy they may think me, has less than steller appreciation for their actions as they impact othersnormally others time. I really don't get excised much here about anything else. Endless editing and all that, after all.Sooooo, Thanks for the appeal to my vanity, but I suggest in the future you counsel people to examine whether a situation is ongoing, escalating, or one time episode of venting. I spent 2-1/2 years here acting as a mediator myself, and would never have considered involving myself in an isolated message based case. Not sensible. Call it justifiable road rage if you like—a real world situation here in cyber space, and  at least I cleaned up the vulgarity of what I had written in the first three drafts, to make my loathing judgment of his lazy rape of hundreds of pages plain. THAT is where I put my loyalty and focus. NOT on one of thousands of arguable interpretation of various guidelines and policies. If your INTERPRETATION of WP:CIV prohibits any colorful idiom or addressing a dumbshit-thing-to-do as a dumbshit act, I'm definitely done here. I'm floored that you haven't the imagination to understand that— save for the hyperbole about kicking ass, a deliberate attempt to indicate how poorly I viewed the 5-6 hours a day of well over six weeks of effort fixing his rape pogrom allegedly following guidelines — nor the fact that you were all being busy-bodies making much ado about nothing. One of the most reprehensible facts about contributing here is that there is a total insensitivity to the leisure time our contributors make, particularly by 'blithely accepting actions', one way or another, deleting their hard work and effort, which is about as personal an attack as one can make...

I don't get her motivation.  This to explain some back and forth editing on this article which you may see.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1. I added mention of the NRHP listing in 1969 of the Jonesboro Historic District, which she then disputed, adding a silly citation needed tag.  As she is well aware from long discussion at the article for that district, it is NRHP listed, that is factual, it is not seriously in doubt.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. I added general mention of the fact that ``A larger area has been promoted as ``Historic Jonesborough`` since then``, to which she added a wp:OR tag and/or removed it in subsequent edits.  In one edit summary, Orlady stated that it ``is speculation and synthesis, including the concepts of ``larger,`` ``promoted as,`` and ``since then.`` Not merely an issue of needing a citation.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOrlady has read numerous webpages of the Historic Jonesborough organization, which I believe was created after 1969 and which certainly has promoted a larger area than the NRHP-listed historic district as Historic Jonesborough since then.  It is a fact, not even a controversial one that the organization has promoted an area since 1969, that the area is larger than the NRHP-listed historic district.  The Historic Jonesborough webpages mention the historic district but do not name it, and they are i-think-deliberately vague on the boundaries of the district but nonetheless adequately imply that the Historic Jonesborough area is larger.  Further, I have verified the facts by reading the NRHP nom document which identifies the area of the historic district, and compared that Historic Jonesborough documents promoting inns and motels inside and outside of that district.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't think this amounts to wp:SYNTH which is original research, to be avoided as perhaps it might advance a controversial POV position.  I believe the current article no longer mentions Historic Jonesborough, which ought to be given pretty salient coverage in the history of this town, for its actions to preserve and promote the town.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. Orlady changes the name of the historic district to display as ``Jonesborough Historic District`` rather than to display as the name it was given in the NRHP listing, ``Jonesboro Historic District``.  That change is possibly implementing wp:OR, as there appear not to be evidence the NRHP listing name is changed.  There is discussion ongoing in a requested move at Talk:Jonesboro Historic District (Jonesborough, Tennessee);  I think the official, original name should be displayed here unless and until there is a different resolution at the article on the district itself.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPerhaps other editors would like to comment on what are the facts, and/or to step in to fix up the article.  Or perhaps you all would prefer to avoid this.  Again, sorry to have brought dispute to here.  `",2011,True,article,blocked,dev

And while I agree a source is not often 100% reliable, especially one relying on opinion...3 major sources IS. Especially given they're frequently used accross Wikipedia. Van Halen began as a hard rock band with a heavy metal edge at times...but ``Dreams`` is definitely a pop rock song. Generally the 1984 album is considered the one where the band became poppier, and in the Sammy Hagar era that really took root. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPower ballads are the most common pop rock crossover out there.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh, and a lot of their covers were poppy songs anyway, like You Really Got Me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have some more stuff below, but first, look at this.

Which is pop metal by the way, making it hard to classify. They went the commercial side of things and moved away from metal. Guns N' Roses, again, sleaze rock. Something that formed from the ashes of glam metal - but Guns N' Roses were among the first. So the line between sleaze and metal blurs with them. They ARE the crossover point. AC/DC I'd not call metal, and I think KISS had a few metal songs but don't really count...but they are heavily disputed the two of them. Opinions on either carry little weight. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia has several definitions for pop rock: ``Pop rock is a subgenre of rock music that uses ``catchy`` pop style, with light lyrics over top of ``guitar-based`` songs``. I would say that sums up some of Van Halen's stuff to a t. ``they only use pop hooks or synths to appeal to both a hard rock and pop audience from time to time``? Have you heard their latter-day singles? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Sure they used synth, and sure they've used pop hooks, but haven't countless other hard rock and heavy metal bands done so?``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt most frequently happened in glam metal. Which is aka pop metal. Glam metal is a genre a lot of people wanted to attach to Van Halen, personally I think just because something's pop rock and heavy metal at different times does not make it pop metal. Hence my desire to keep pop rock - the comparisons to glam metal are made obvious that way. It's hard to ignore them, but also impossible to just call it glam metal.`",2007,True,user,random,test

[|Jason Giambi]would move to the New York Yankees after winning the MVP award in 2001 with the Oakland Athletics. There he would never truly live up to his potential, until the year of our lord 2008. Going into the 2008 season that New York Yankees had a positive outlook returning countless all-star veterans, including [|Giambi], mixed with a crop of young talent not seen in the Yankee farm system in years. As the season progressed the Yankees did not reach the expectations of themselves, fans, and the entire front office. As the Yankees stumbled along, one of the bright spots was the fairly consistent play of [|Jason Giambi]. Minimal expectations had been placed upon him for the year, and his contributions had been important to the team staying above .500. With his fan popularity growing, he decided to try something that some may call ugly, but others may call the pinnacle of a potential religious or governmental view. As the fans and himself refer to it as, ``the stache``, it has become an icon for not only [|Giambi], but the entire Yankee team. With other players such as Andy Pettite and Johnny Damon joining [|Giambi] with the facial hair, than shaving away, it was clear that this simple patch of lip fur was here to stay. Despite some claims that ``Just For Men`` has been involved in the increasing color and thickness of said ``stache``, there have been no official remarks from [|Giambi]. The infusion of the ``stache`` into the everyday life of Yankee fans has formed the potential for a governmental ideology, justly named the Giambigarchy. It is a simple view which includes drinking plenty of beer, and growing incredible upper lip fur. A view that may conflict with the current Republican/Democratic debate for the upcoming election, but surely a view that would not start any wars in Iraq, or drive gasoline prices over $4.00/gallon. We of the Giambigarchy way of view encourage you took to take a long look at your own ``stache`` and ask, ``Do I represent myself the way [|Jason Giambi] and his facial attributes do?`` That is the only question required for acceptance of the Giambigarchy point of view, and we recommend any fan ask themselves that question. The governmental form under the Giambigarchy is a very open-minded yet structured form that allows for the basic freedoms of its followers, and party members, yet remains an extremely fun-loving and positive outlook on life that other religions, and governments have failed to achieve. The savior [|Jason Giambi] has led by example to bring together his followers, encouraging them to live their lives with what is referred to as ``stassion``. This is a twist on passion, as of course one must dawn the proverbial mustache. This very close knit, and increasingly popular group has reached a new way of life, and the numbers of proud followers are completely staggering. Established in May of 2008, Giambigarchy registered members have reached to a total of 13,422 (as of July 5th, 2008).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWork Cited: ``U.S. Retail Gasoline Prices.`` Weekly U.S. Retail Gasoline Prices, Regular Grade.

You, me & Srikanth have had several discussions across a range of topics but i don't recall we have cut each others work. We have basically agreed to disagree while maintaining facts & opinions separate from each other. Ofcourse i have made deletions but i have tried and later on as i have learned the ropes given reasons for what i have done. Do me a favour,go to Surat Railway station & Mumbai Rajdhani's pages and compare the image. I cant figure out how the same images shows Mumbai Central & Surat station as being identical right down to the background but a certain individual does claim that i am wrong. Thanks for the word of support, i was beginning to feel alone in the fight. All the images i have uploaded is through commons & all the images have been taken by me so there are no copyright issues anywhere.NEWLINE_TOKEN  ",2013,True,user,blocked,dev

This has been done under section A1 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because it is a very short article providing little or no context to the reader.

To state otherwise is a lie and OR.  Just be it is a contraversy page doesn't allow you state lies or add OR, you can list things as misinterpretations of the rules and things like that but it you try to say scouting does this or scouting does that then you need to be sure scouting actually says that.
